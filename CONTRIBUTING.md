Getting Started

Prerequisites

· Node.js (v18 or higher)
· MySQL (v8.0 or higher) or your preferred database
· Git

First-time Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bus-reservation-system.git
   cd bus-reservation-system
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database credentials and API keys
   ```
5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Development Workflow

Branch Strategy

· main - production-ready code
· develop - integration branch for features
· feature/* - new features
· fix/* - bug fixes
· docs/* - documentation improvements

Creating a New Feature

1. Create a new branch from develop:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes
3. Add tests for your changes
4. Update documentation if needed
5. Submit a pull request to develop

Commit Message Convention

We follow Conventional Commits:

```
feat: add seat selection component
fix: resolve payment validation issue
docs: update API documentation
style: improve responsive design
refactor: simplify booking logic
test: add unit tests for user authentication
chore: update dependencies
```

Code Standards

Frontend (React)

```javascript
// Use functional components with hooks
const BookingForm = ({ userId, onSuccess }) => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  
  // Descriptive variable names
  const availableSeats = filterSeats(seats, 'available');
  
  return (
    // JSX with proper formatting
  );
};
```

Backend (Node.js/Express)

```javascript
// Use async/await for database operations
const createBooking = async (bookingData) => {
  try {
    const result = await db.Booking.create(bookingData);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Booking creation failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
};

// Consistent error handling
app.use((error, req, res, next) => {
  logger.error(error);
  res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
});
```

Database

· Use meaningful table and column names
· Follow snake_case convention for database objects
· Add indexes for frequently queried columns
· Include foreign key constraints

Testing

```javascript
// Write meaningful test descriptions
describe('Booking Service', () => {
  it('should create a booking with valid data', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  it('should reject booking with invalid seat number', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```
